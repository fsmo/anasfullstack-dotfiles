## Passive information gathering
1. Google
	- use search terms like: insite, intitle, intext, .    
	- Check Google dorks [Google dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
2. Email Harvesting
	- Use shell command
		```shell
		theharvester -d target.com -b google >target_google.txt
		theharvester -d target.com -l 10 -b bing >target_bing.txt
		```
3. Netcraft

4. Whois
	```Bash
	Whois target.com
	whois 10.10.10.10
	```
5. Recon-ng
	- We’ll start by using the whois_poc module to come up with employee names and email addresses
		```Bash
		root@kali:~# recon-ng
		[recon-ng][default] > use recon/contacts/gather/http/api/whois_pocs
		```
	- Next, we can use recon-ng to search sources such as xssed for existing XSS vulnerabilities that have been reported, but not yet fixed
		```Bash
		recon-ng > use recon/hosts/enum/http/web/xssed
		```
	- We can also use the google_site module to search for additional target.com subdomains, via the Google search engine
		```Bash
		recon­-ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/google_site
		```
	- Another useful example is the ip_neighbour module, which attempts to discover neighbouring IP addresses of the target domain, possibly discovering other domains in the process.
		```Bash
		recon-ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/ip_neighbor
		```
	> Many of the modules in recon-ng require API keys with their respective service providers. Take some time to check out recon-ng and its various modules

## Active Information Gathering

1. DNS Enumeration

	DNS offers a variety of information about public (and sometimes private!) organization servers, such as IP addresses, server names, and server functionality.

	- Interacting with a DNS Server
		```Bash
 		host -t ns megacorpone.com           # -t : type , ns: dns
		host -t mx megacorpone.com           # mx : mail server
		```
	- Automating lookups

		we have some initial data from the megacorpone.com domain, we can continue to use additional DNS queries to discover more host names and IP addresses belonging to megacorpone.com.

		```Bash
		host www.megacorpone.com             # we will found that it has an ip
		host idontexist.megacorpone.com      # this is not found

		```
	- Forward Lookup Brute Force

		Taking the previous concept a step further, we can automate the Forward DNS Lookup of common host names using the host command and a Bash script.
		```shell
		echo www > list.txt
		echo ftp >> list.txt
		echo mail >> list.txt
		echo owa >> list.txt
		echo proxy >> list.txt
		echo router >> list.txt
		echo api >> list.txt
		for ip in $(cat list.txt);do host $ip.megacorpone.com;done
		```
	- Reverse Lookup Brute Force

		If the DNS administrator of megacorpone.com configured PTR records for the domain, we might find out some more domain names that were missed during the forward lookup brute-force phase.
		```shell
		for ip in $(seq 155 190);do host 50.7.67.$ip;done | grep -v "not found"
		# grep -v :: --invert-match
		```
	- DNS Zone Transfers

		A zone transfer is similar to a database replication act between related DNS servers. This process includes the copying of the zone file from a master DNS server to a slave server. The zone file contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone. Zone transfers should usually be limited to authorized slave DNS servers.
		```shell
		host -l megacorpone.com ns1.megacorpone.com   # ns1 refused us our zone transfer request
		# -l :: list all hosts in a domain
		host -l megacorpone.com ns2.megacorpone.com
		# The result is a full dump of the zone file for the megacorpone.com domain,
		# providing us a convenient list of IPs and DNS names for the megacorpone.com domain.
		```
		- Now Lets automate the process:

			- To get the name servers for a given domain in a clean format, we can issue the following command.

				```shell
				host -t ns megacorpone.com | cut -d " " -f 4
				# -d :: --delimiter=DELIM ;
				# -f ::  --fields=LIST select only these fields on each line;
				````
			- Taking this a step further, we could write the following simple Bash script to automate the procedure of discovering and attempting a zone transfer on each DNS server found.

				```shell
				# /bin/bash
				# Simple Zone Transfer Bash Script
				# $1 is the first argument given after the bash script
				# Check if argument was given, if not, print usage
				if  [-z "$1" ]; then
				echo "[*] Simple Zone transfer script"
				echo "[*] Usage : $0 <domain name> "
				exit 0
				fi

				# if argument was given, identify the DNS servers for the domain
				for server in $(host ­-t ns $1 | cut ­-d" " ­-f4);do
				# For each of these servers, attempt a zone transfer
				host -l $1 $server | grep "has address"
				done
				```

				Running this script on megacorpone.com should automatically identify both name servers and attempt a zone transfer on each of them

				```shell
				root@kali:~# chmod 755 dns-­-axfr.sh
				root@kali:~# ./dns-­-axfr.sh megacorpone.com
				```

			dnsrecon -d megacorpone.com -t axfr
			# -d :: domain
			# -t :: type of Enumeration to perform
			# axfr :: test all ns servers for zone transfer
			```
		- DNSEnum
			```

2. Port Scanning
	---

	Port scanning is the process of checking for open TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine.

	> **Please note that port scanning is illegal in many countries and should not be performed outside the labs.**

	- Connect Scanning

		The simplest TCP port scanning technique, usually called CONNECT scanning, relies on the three-­--way TCP handshake26 mechanism.

		Connect port scanning involves attempting to complete a three-way handshake with the target host on the specified port(s). If the handshake is completed, this indicates that the port is open.
		```shell
		# TCP Netcat port scan on ports 3388-3390
		nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.0.0.19 3388-3390
		# -n :: numeric only ip adressess no DNS
		# -v :: verboose use twice to be more verboose
		# -w :: (secs) timeout for connects and final net reads
		# -z :: zero I/O mode (used for scanning)
		```
	- Stealth / SYN Scanning

		SYN scanning, or stealth scanning, is a TCP port scanning method that involves sending SYN packets to various ports on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake. If a TCP port is open, a SYN-­--ACK should be sent back from the target machine, informing us that the port is open, without the need to send a final ACK back to the target machine.

		With early and primitive firewalls, this method would often bypass firewall logging, as this logging was limited to completed TCP sessions. This is no longer true with modern firewalls, and the term stealth is misleading. Users might believe their scans will somehow not be detected, when in fact, they will be.

	- UDP Scanning
		```shell
		nc -nv -u -z -w 1 10.0-0.19 160-162
		# -u :: UDP mode
		```
	- Common Port Scanning Pitfalls

		- UDP port scanning is often unreliable, as firewalls and routers may drop ICMP packets. This can lead to false positives in your scan, and you will regularly see UDP port scans showing all UDP ports open on a scanned machine.
		- Most port scanners do not scan all available ports, and usually have a preset list of “interesting ports” that are scanned.
		- People often forget to scan for UDP services, and stick only to TCP scanning, thereby seeing only half of the equation.

	- Port Scanning with Nmap

		- Accountability for Your Traffic

			A default nmap TCP scan will scan the 1000 most popular ports on a given machine.
			```shell
			# We’ll scan one of my local machines while monitoring the amount
			# of traffic sent to the specific host using iptables.
			iptables -I INPUT 1 -s 10.0.0.19 -j ACCEPT
			iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 10.0.0.19 -j ACCEPT
			iptables -Z
			# -I :: insert in chain as rulenum ( default 1=first)
			# -s :: source (address)
			# -j :: jump target for the rulw
			# -Z :: ??

			nmpap -sT 10.0.0.9
			iptables -vn -L
			iptables -Z
			# -sT :: TCP Connect Scan
			# -v :: Display more information in the output
			# -L :: List the current filter rules.

			nmap -sT -p 1-65635 10.0.0.19
			iptables -vn -L
			# -p :: port range
			```
			- This default 1000 port scan has generated around 72KB of traffic.
			-  A similar local port scan explicitly probing all 65535 ports would generate about 4.5 MB of traffic, a significantly higher amount.
			- However, this full port scan has discovered two new ports that were not found by the default TCP scan: ports 180 and 25017.

			**Full nmap scan of a class C network (254 hosts) would result in sending over 1000 MB of traffic to the network.**

			__So, if we are in a position where we can’t run a full port scan on the network, what can we do?__

		- Network Sweeping

			- To deal with large volumes of hosts, or to otherwise try to conserve network traffic, we can attempt to probe these machines using Network Sweeping techniques.

			- Machines that filter or block ICMP requests may seem down to a ping sweep, so it is not a definitive way to identify which machines are really up or down.
			```shell
			nmap -sn 192.168.11.200-250
			# -sn :: ping scan
			# using the grep command can give you output that’s difficult to manage.
			# let’s use Nmap’s “greppable” output parameter (-oG)
			nmap -v -sn 192.168.11.200-250 -oG ping-sweep.txt
			grep Up ping-sweep.txt | cut -d " " -f 2

			# we can sweep for specific TCP or UDP ports (-p) across the network
			nmap ­-p 80 192.168.11.200-250 -oG web-sweep.txt
			grep open web­-sweep.txt |cut ­-d " " -f 2

			# we are conducting a scan for the top 20 TCP ports.
			nmap –sT –A --top­-ports=20 192.168.11.200-250 –oG top­-port-­sweep.txt
			```

			- Machines that prove to be rich in services, or otherwise interesting, would then be individually port scanned, using a more exhaustive port list.

	- OS Fingerprinting
		```shell
		# OS fingerprinting (-O parameter).
		nmap -O 10.0.0.19
		```
	- Banner Grabbing/Service Enumeration

		Nmap can also help identify services on specific ports, by banner grabbing, and running several enumeration scripts (-sV and -A parameters).
		```shell
		nmap -sV -sT 10.0.0.19
		# -sV :: probe open ports to determine service / version info
		```
	- Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

		- The scripts include a broad range of utilities, from DNS enumeration scripts, brute force attack scripts, and even vulnerability identification scripts.

		- All NSE scripts can be found in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory

		```shell
		nmap 10.0.0.19 --script smb-os-discovery.nse
		# Another useful script is the DNS zone transfer NSE script
		nmap --script=dns-zone-transfer -p 53 ns2.megacorpone.com
		```
3. SMB Enumeration
	---

	```
	SMB1   – Windows 2000, XP and Windows 2003.
	SMB2   – Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 2008
	SMB2.1 – Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2
	SMB3   – Windows 8 and Windows 2012.
	```

	- Scanning for the NetBIOS Service

		- The SMB NetBIOS32 service listens on TCP ports 139 and 445, as well as several UDP ports.
			```sell
			nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.11.200-254
			```

		- There are other, more specialized, tools for specifically identifying NetBIOS information
			```
			nbtscan -r 192.168.11.0/24
			```
	- Null Session Enumeration

		- A null session refers to an unauthenticated NetBIOS session between two computers. This feature exists to allow unauthenticated machines to obtain browse lists from other Microsoft servers.

		- A null session also allows unauthenticated hackers to obtain large amounts of information about the machine, such as password policies, usernames, group names, machine names, user and host SIDs.

		- This Microsoft feature existed in SMB1 by default and was later restricted in subsequent versions of SMB.

		```
		enum4linux -a 192.168.11.227
		```
	- Nmap SMB NSE Scripts

		```shell
		# These scripts can be found in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts directory
		ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*
