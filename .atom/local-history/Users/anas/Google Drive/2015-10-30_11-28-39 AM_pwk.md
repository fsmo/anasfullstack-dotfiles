# PWK cheat sheet

## Passive information gathering
1. Google
	- use search terms like: insite, intitle, intext, .    
	- Check Google dorks [Google dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
2. Email Harvesting
	- Use shell command
	```shell
	theharvester -d target.com -b google >target_google.txt
	theharvester -d target.com -l 10 -b bing >target_bing.txt
	```
3. Netcraft
	- [netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/)
	- [search dns](http://searchdns.netcraft.com/)
	- [Search Engine Features Chart](http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/)
4. Whois
	```shell
Whois target.com
whois 10.10.10.10
	```
5. Recon-ng
	- We’ll start by using the whois_poc module to come up with employee names and email addresses
```shell
root@kali:~# recon‐ng
[recon‐ng][default] > use recon/contacts/gather/http/api/whois_pocs
```
	- Next, we can use recon‑ng to search sources such as xssed for existing XSS
vulnerabilities that have been reported, but not yet fixed
```shell
recon‐ng > use recon/hosts/enum/http/web/xssed
```
	- We can also use the google_site module to search for additional target.com subdomains,
via the Google search engine
```shell
	recon­‐ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/google_site
```
	- Another useful example is the ip_neighbour module, which attempts to discover
neighbouring IP addresses of the target domain, possibly discovering other domains in
the process.
```shell
recon‐ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/ip_neighbor
```
