# PWK cheat sheet

## Passive information gathering
1. Google
	- use search terms like: insite, intitle, intext, .    
	- Check Google dorks [Google dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
2. Email Harvesting
	- Use shell command
		```shell
		theharvester -d target.com -b google >target_google.txt
		theharvester -d target.com -l 10 -b bing >target_bing.txt
		```
3. Netcraft
	- [netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/)
	- [search dns](http://searchdns.netcraft.com/)
	- [Search Engine Features Chart](http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/)
4. Whois
	```Bash
	Whois target.com
	whois 10.10.10.10
	```
5. Recon-ng
	- We’ll start by using the whois_poc module to come up with employee names and email addresses
		```Bash
		root@kali:~# recon‐ng
		[recon‐ng][default] > use recon/contacts/gather/http/api/whois_pocs
		```
	- Next, we can use recon‑ng to search sources such as xssed for existing XSS vulnerabilities that have been reported, but not yet fixed
		```Bash
		recon‐ng > use recon/hosts/enum/http/web/xssed
		```
	- We can also use the google_site module to search for additional target.com subdomains, via the Google search engine
		```Bash
		recon­‐ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/google_site
		```
	- Another useful example is the ip_neighbour module, which attempts to discover neighbouring IP addresses of the target domain, possibly discovering other domains in the process.
		```Bash
		recon‐ng > use recon/hosts/gather/http/web/ip_neighbor
		```
	> Many of the modules in recon‑ng require API keys with their respective service providers. Take some time to check out recon‑ng and its various modules

## Active Information Gathering

1. DNS Enumeration
	---

	DNS offers a variety of information about public (and sometimes private!) organization servers, such as IP addresses, server names, and server functionality.

	- Interacting with a DNS Server
		```Bash
 		host -t ns megacorpone.com           # -t : type , ns: dns
		host -t mx megacorpone.com           # mx : mail server
		```
	- Automating lookups

		we have some initial data from the megacorpone.com domain, we can continue to use additional DNS queries to discover more host names and IP addresses belonging to megacorpone.com.

		```Bash
		host www.megacorpone.com             # we will found that it has an ip
		host idontexist.megacorpone.com      # this is not found

		```
	- Forward Lookup Brute Force

		Taking the previous concept a step further, we can automate the Forward DNS Lookup of common host names using the host command and a Bash script.
		```shell
		echo www > list.txt
		echo ftp >> list.txt
		echo mail >> list.txt
		echo owa >> list.txt
		echo proxy >> list.txt
		echo router >> list.txt
		echo api >> list.txt
		for ip in $(cat list.txt);do host $ip.megacorpone.com;done
		```
	- Reverse Lookup Brute Force

		If the DNS administrator of megacorpone.com configured PTR records for the domain, we might find out some more domain names that were missed during the forward lookup brute‑force phase.
		```shell
		for ip in $(seq 155 190);do host 50.7.67.$ip;done | grep ‐v "not found"
		# grep -v :: --invert-match
		```
	- DNS Zone Transfers

		A zone transfer is similar to a database replication act between related DNS servers. This process includes the copying of the zone file from a master DNS server to a slave server. The zone file contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone. Zone transfers should usually be limited to authorized slave DNS servers.
		```shell
		host -l megacorpone.com ns1.megacorpone.com   # ns1 refused us our zone transfer request
		# -l :: list all hosts in a domain
		host -l megacorpone.com ns2.megacorpone.com
		# The result is a full dump of the zone file for the megacorpone.com domain,
		# providing us a convenient list of IPs and DNS names for the megacorpone.com domain.
		```
		- Now Lets automate the process:

			- To get the name servers for a given domain in a clean format, we can issue the following command.

				```shell
				host -t ns megacorpone.com | cut -d " " -f 4
				# -d :: --delimiter=DELIM ;
				# -f ::  --fields=LIST select only these fields on each line;
				````
			- Taking this a step further, we could write the following simple Bash script to automate the procedure of discovering and attempting a zone transfer on each DNS server found.

				```shell
				# /bin/bash
				# Simple Zone Transfer Bash Script
				# $1 is the first argument given after the bash script
				# Check if argument was given, if not, print usage
				if  [‐z "$1" ]; then
				echo "[*] Simple Zone transfer script"
				echo "[*] Usage : $0 <domain name> "
				exit 0
				fi

				# if argument was given, identify the DNS servers for the domain
				for server in $(host ­‐t ns $1 | cut ­‐d" " ­‐f4);do
				# For each of these servers, attempt a zone transfer
				host ‐l $1 $server | grep "has address"
				done
				```

				Running this script on megacorpone.com should automatically identify both name servers and attempt a zone transfer on each of them

				```shell
				root@kali:~# chmod 755 dns-­‐axfr.sh
				root@kali:~# ./dns-­‐axfr.sh megacorpone.com
				```
	- Relevant Tools in Kali Linux
		- DNSRecon
			```shell
			dnsrecon ‐d megacorpone.com ‐t axfr
			# -d :: domain
			# -t :: type of Enumeration to perform
			# axfr :: test all ns servers for zone transfer
			```
		- DNSEnum
			```
			dnsenum zonetransfer.me
			```
2. Port Scanning
	---

	Port scanning is the process of checking for open TCP or UDP ports on a remote machine.

	> **Please note that port scanning is illegal in many countries and should not be performed outside the labs.**

	- Connect Scanning

		The simplest TCP port scanning technique, usually called CONNECT scanning, relies on the three-­‐‑way TCP handshake26 mechanism.
