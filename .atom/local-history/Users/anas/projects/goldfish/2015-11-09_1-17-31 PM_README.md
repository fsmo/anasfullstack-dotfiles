  ## To make the RTC media run on Xcode

  - open the project with Xcode and follow these steps:

    - Set "iOS Deployment Target" to `7.0` or higher within your project settings.
    - Set "Deployment Target" to `7.0` or higher within the project target settings.
    - Within the project "Build Settings" add an entry to the "Runpath Search Paths" setting with value `@executable_path/Frameworks`.
    - Within the project "Build Settings" set "Objective-C Bridging Header" to `PROJECT_NAME/Plugins/cordova-plugin-iosrtc/cordova-plugin-iosrtc-Bridging-Header.h` (read more about the "Bridging Header" above).
    - Within the project "Build Settings" set "Enable Bitcode" to "No" (this will be addressed soon).
