# Vulnerability Scanning

  > Vulnerability scans can generate a great deal of traffic and, in some cases, can even result in denial of service conditions on many network devices, so caution must be exercised before making use of mass vulnerability scanners on a penetration test.

  1. ###Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

      - to get all available Nmap Vulnerabilities scripts

      ```shell
      > cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
      > ls -l *vuln*
      ```

      - Then start Using one of them
      - We will see in the  output that not only did Nmap will find if the server is vulnerable; it also retrieved the admin'ʹs password hash.

      ```shell
      > nmap -v -p 80 --script=http-vuln-cve2010-2861 192.168.11.210
      ```

      - The ftp-anon NSE script lets us quickly scan a range of IP addresses for FTP servers that allow anonymous access

      ```shell
      > nmap -v -p 21 --script=ftp-anon.nse 192.168.11.200-254
      ```

      - we can check the security level of an SMB server with the smb-security-mode NSE scrip

      ```shell
      > nmap -v -p 139, 445 --script=smb-security-mode 192.168.11.236
      ```

       - Beyond penetration testing, network administrators can also benefit from NSE scripts, by verifiying that patches have been applied against a group of servers or workstations.
       - For example, you can use nmap data to verify that all domain web servers have been patched against CVE-2011-319240, an Apache denial of service vulnerability.

       ```shell
       > nmap -v -p 80 --script=http-vuln-cve2011-3192 192.168.11.205-­‐210
       ```
