# Vulnerability Scanning

  > Vulnerability scans can generate a great deal of traffic and, in some cases, can even result in denial of service conditions on many network devices, so caution must be exercised before making use of mass vulnerability scanners on a penetration test.

  1. ###Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

      ```shell
      # to get all available Nmap Vulnerabilities scripts
      > cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
      > ls -l *vuln*  
      # 
      > 
      ```
