### FireWalls

  - Types:
    - Packet Inspection
    - Application Filtering
    - Stateful FireWalls
  - If the rule is triggered, the firewalls will block the traffic.
  - It may block by Ip address or port address.
  - DMZ usually should be put out of your internal network  & put between two firewalls.

### Routers

  - Secure router Configuration.
  - Routing tables.
  - Hub sends the packet to every port every time.
  - Switch sends the packet to every port in the first time, in the second time it learnt the mac address from the first time, so it only send it to the right port.
  - MAC address is 48-bit.
  - Load balancers. (Distributing loads on servers and at the end synchronization happened to make sure that all the data is the same on all servers).

### Proxies

  - Types
    - Forwarding Proxies
    - Reverse Proxies
  - They may be routers or servers.
  - __NAT__:  network address Translation :is translating the internal private addresses to the proxy public address.
  - Benefits of Forwading proxy & NAT:
    - Multiple PCs share the same public address
    - caching (if the same request is repeated)
    - provide some security(because the outer world does not see the Ips behind it)
  - #### Reverse Proxies:
    - Protecting servers from malicious requests
    - Also Filtering the server responses and blocking the malicious responses
### VPN (virtual private network) and the VPN concentrators.
