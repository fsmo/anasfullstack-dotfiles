### Test Network/Infrastructure Configuration (OTG-CONFIG-001)

  - #### The following steps need to be taken to test the configuration management infrastructure:
    - The different elements that make up the infrastructure need to be determined in order to understand how they interact with a web application and how they affect its security.
    - All the elements of the infrastructure need to be reviewed in order to make sure that they donâ€™t contain any known vulnerabilities.
    - A review needs to be made of the administrative tools used to maintain all the different elements.
    - The authentication systems, need to reviewed in order to assure that they serve the needs of the application and that they cannot be manipulated by external users to leverage access.
    - A list of defined ports which are required for the application should be maintained and kept under change control.
