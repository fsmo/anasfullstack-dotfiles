### Test Network/Infrastructure Configuration (OTG-CONFIG-001)

  - #### The following steps need to be taken to test the configuration management infrastructure:
    - The different elements that make up the infrastructure need to be determined in order to understand how they interact with a web application and how they affect its security.
    - All the elements of the infrastructure need to be reviewed in order to make sure that they donâ€™t contain any known vulnerabilities.
    - A review needs to be made of the administrative tools used to maintain all the different elements.
    - The authentication systems, need to reviewed in order to assure that they serve the needs of the application and that they cannot be manipulated by external users to leverage access.
    - A list of defined ports which are required for the application should be maintained and kept under change control.
  - #### How to Test
    - Known Server Vulnerabilities
    > Some automated tools will flag vulnerabilities based on the web server version retrieved. This leads to both false positives and false negatives. On one hand, if the web server version has been removed or obscured by the local site administrator the scan tool will not  flag the server as vulnerable even if it is.

    - Administrative tools
      - Determine the mechanisms that control access to these interfaces and their associated susceptibilities. This information may be available online.
      - Change the default username and password.

### Test Application Platform Configuration (OTG-CONFIG-002)

  - #### How to Test
    - Black Box Testing
      - Sample and known files and directories
      - Code Comments review
    - Gray Box Testing
      - Configuration review
        - It is impossible to generically say how a server should be configured, however, some common guidelines should be taken into account:
          - Only enable server modules (ISAPI extensions in the case of IIS) that are needed for the application.
          - Handle server errors (40x or 50x) with custom-made pages instead of with the default web server pages.
          - Make sure that the server software runs with minimized privileges
in the operating system.
